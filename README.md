# 1150.CarbTracker
Greeting from FOG (Frickin’ Old Guys; Bob, Rod, and Ross)

Our project is based upon keeping track of carbohydrates for diabetics.

We have a total of five tables in the database. These tables can be viewed at this link: https://dbdiagram.io/d/60425f3efcdcb6230b22ccaa.

More information regarding the project is at this Trello address: https://trello.com/b/guR1Wkxs/nutrition-and-dieting

To run out project, you’ll need to start the API by opening CarbTracker.sln and CarbTracker.ConsoleUI.sln. We have a console app front end for the API. The API has to be running in order for the Console App to work.

The first option is to create a new user or enter the email and password for a current user. This information is validated so the program won’t crash.

Next, you’ll see a 10 item menu which is self-explanatory. The two choices which list the food and meals needed a way to translate the data in the tables to a JSON file, making it easier to display the data. Here’s a link to stackoverflow which explain the translation: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39723128/converting-a-string-to-json-in-c-sharp
